## 902297:                           EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense upper level low developed on the 28th at the base of a highly amplified upper trough across the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley.  The upper low closed off over the mid South and tracked northeast across the Tennessee Valley during the morning of the 29th.   A warm conveyor belt of heavy rainfall developed in advance of the low which dumped from around 2 to over 5 inches of rain across the eastern two thirds of north Alabama and middle Tennessee.  The highest rain amounts were recorded in Jackson and DeKalb Counties with 3 to 5 inches.  The rain fell over 24 to 36 hour period, with rainfall remaining light to moderate during most its duration.  The rainfall resulted in minor river flooding along the Little River, Big Wills Creek and Paint Rock.   A landslide occurred on Highway 35 just north of Section in Jackson County.  A driver was trapped in his vehicle, but was rescued unharmed.  Trees, boulders and debris blocked 100 to 250 yards of Highway 35.\n\nThe rain mixed with and changed to snow across north Alabama during the afternoon and  evening hours of the 28th, and lasted into the 29th.  The heaviest bursts of snow occurred in northwest Alabama during the afternoon and evening hours, and in north central and northeast Alabama during the overnight and morning hours.  Since ground temperatures were in the 50s, and air temperatures in valley areas only dropped into the mid 30s, most of the snowfall melted on impact with mostly trace amounts reported in valley locations.  However, above 1500 foot elevation, snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches were reported.  The heaviest amount was 2.3 inches on Monte Sano Mountain, about 5 miles northeast of Huntsville.EVENT NARRATIVE: Snowfall accumulations of up to 2.3 inches were reported on the higher elevations of eastern Madison County.  A snow accumulation of 1.5 inches was reported 2.7 miles south of Gurley, while 2.3 inches was reported 3 miles east of Huntsville atop Monte Sano Mountain.

## 902297:                           EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense upper level low developed on the 28th at the base of a highly amplified upper trough across the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley.  The upper low closed off over the mid South and tracked northeast across the Tennessee Valley during the morning of the 29th.   A warm conveyor belt of heavy rainfall developed in advance of the low which dumped from around 2 to over 5 inches of rain across the eastern two thirds of north Alabama and middle Tennessee.  The highest rain amounts were recorded in Jackson and DeKalb Counties with 3 to 5 inches.  The rain fell over 24 to 36 hour period, with rainfall remaining light to moderate during most its duration.  The rainfall resulted in minor river flooding along the Little River, Big Wills Creek and Paint Rock.   A landslide occurred on Highway 35 just north of Section in Jackson County.  A driver was trapped in his vehicle, but was rescued unharmed.  Trees, boulders and debris blocked 100 to 250 yards of Highway 35.\n\nThe rain mixed with and changed to snow across north Alabama during the afternoon and  evening hours of the 28th, and lasted into the 29th.  The heaviest bursts of snow occurred in northwest Alabama during the afternoon and evening hours, and in north central and northeast Alabama during the overnight and morning hours.  Since ground temperatures were in the 50s, and air temperatures in valley areas only dropped into the mid 30s, most of the snowfall melted on impact with mostly trace amounts reported in valley locations.  However, above 1500 foot elevation, snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches were reported.  The heaviest amount was 2.3 inches on Monte Sano Mountain, about 5 miles northeast of Huntsville.EVENT NARRATIVE: Snowfall accumulations of up to 2.3 inches were reported on the higher elevations of eastern Madison County.  A snow accumulation of 1.5 inches was reported 2.7 miles south of Gurley, while 2.3 inches was reported 3 miles east of Huntsville atop Monte Sano Mountain.

## 902297:                           EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense upper level low developed on the 28th at the base of a highly amplified upper trough across the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley.  The upper low closed off over the mid South and tracked northeast across the Tennessee Valley during the morning of the 29th.   A warm conveyor belt of heavy rainfall developed in advance of the low which dumped from around 2 to over 5 inches of rain across the eastern two thirds of north Alabama and middle Tennessee.  The highest rain amounts were recorded in Jackson and DeKalb Counties with 3 to 5 inches.  The rain fell over 24 to 36 hour period, with rainfall remaining light to moderate during most its duration.  The rainfall resulted in minor river flooding along the Little River, Big Wills Creek and Paint Rock.   A landslide occurred on Highway 35 just north of Section in Jackson County.  A driver was trapped in his vehicle, but was rescued unharmed.  Trees, boulders and debris blocked 100 to 250 yards of Highway 35.\n\nThe rain mixed with and changed to snow across north Alabama during the afternoon and  evening hours of the 28th, and lasted into the 29th.  The heaviest bursts of snow occurred in northwest Alabama during the afternoon and evening hours, and in north central and northeast Alabama during the overnight and morning hours.  Since ground temperatures were in the 50s, and air temperatures in valley areas only dropped into the mid 30s, most of the snowfall melted on impact with mostly trace amounts reported in valley locations.  However, above 1500 foot elevation, snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches were reported.  The heaviest amount was 2.3 inches on Monte Sano Mountain, about 5 miles northeast of Huntsville.EVENT NARRATIVE: Snowfall accumulations of up to 2.3 inches were reported on the higher elevations of eastern Madison County.  A snow accumulation of 1.5 inches was reported 2.7 miles south of Gurley, while 2.3 inches was reported 3 miles east of Huntsville atop Monte Sano Mountain.

## 902297:                           EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense upper level low developed on the 28th at the base of a highly amplified upper trough across the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley.  The upper low closed off over the mid South and tracked northeast across the Tennessee Valley during the morning of the 29th.   A warm conveyor belt of heavy rainfall developed in advance of the low which dumped from around 2 to over 5 inches of rain across the eastern two thirds of north Alabama and middle Tennessee.  The highest rain amounts were recorded in Jackson and DeKalb Counties with 3 to 5 inches.  The rain fell over 24 to 36 hour period, with rainfall remaining light to moderate during most its duration.  The rainfall resulted in minor river flooding along the Little River, Big Wills Creek and Paint Rock.   A landslide occurred on Highway 35 just north of Section in Jackson County.  A driver was trapped in his vehicle, but was rescued unharmed.  Trees, boulders and debris blocked 100 to 250 yards of Highway 35.\n\nThe rain mixed with and changed to snow across north Alabama during the afternoon and  evening hours of the 28th, and lasted into the 29th.  The heaviest bursts of snow occurred in northwest Alabama during the afternoon and evening hours, and in north central and northeast Alabama during the overnight and morning hours.  Since ground temperatures were in the 50s, and air temperatures in valley areas only dropped into the mid 30s, most of the snowfall melted on impact with mostly trace amounts reported in valley locations.  However, above 1500 foot elevation, snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches were reported.  The heaviest amount was 2.3 inches on Monte Sano Mountain, about 5 miles northeast of Huntsville.EVENT NARRATIVE: Snowfall accumulations of up to 2.3 inches were reported on the higher elevations of eastern Madison County.  A snow accumulation of 1.5 inches was reported 2.7 miles south of Gurley, while 2.3 inches was reported 3 miles east of Huntsville atop Monte Sano Mountain.
